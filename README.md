# highload-wallet with comment support
This repository contains a version of standart highload-wallet from [smartcont](https://github.com/newton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/smartcont) folder, which supports sending comments along with transfers. Note that I have only edited the fift script to add support for comments. All other code was borrowed from the original repo.
